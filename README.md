We were able to extract 10x more data and decided which categories to filter out. We also worked on avoiding bot detection. We decided on using Dash to make a final product. 

1. The dash website should first make the consumer choose a category among Fresh Produce, Meat & Seafood, Snacks, Beverages, Breakfast & Cereal, Bakery, Dairy & Eggs, and Frozen. 
2. After choosing the category, the consumer searches for the product they are trying to purchase. Then the dash website should return a list of products in order of low Price/Quantity of both Target and wholefoods separately. 
3. The list of products is from everything in "Name" column that contains the keyword that consumer searched for. For instance, if the consumer searched for "watermelon" the website's list should have "Fresh Cut Watermelon". 
4. The consumer repeats searching for the products they want to purchase, and the price gets accumulated. 
5. The website finally compares the total price of the two groceries, in the case of purchasing the products in that combination the consumer chose. 

***Thus this interactive website will then visualize the price data, enabling users to easily compare items and make cost-effective shopping decisions.
